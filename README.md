# Regression Models to predict Dissolved Inorganic Carbon using Ocean Chemistry features

## Background
I build three different models (using single decision tree, random forest, and stochastic gradient boosted trees) that predict **dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)** content in water samples. The features being used to make these predictions are other ocean chemistry measurements that were also measured during water sampling. The data set comes from the **California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI)**, an oceanographic and marine ecosystem research program located in California ([link to data set source](https://calcofi.org/data/oceanographic-data/bottle-database/)). All water samples were taken off the California coast.
